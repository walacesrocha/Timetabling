sbpo-latex
======================================================================

This project holds Latex styles for the Brazilian Symposium of Operational
Research papers. It was firstly provided by Jomi Hubner and Rafael Bordini
at 2001. It had some adaptations on the meantime by other contributors.

Besides the Latex and Bibtex styles, it is included a template named
"sbpo-sample.tex" which can be used as a working example of functionalities.

If you have some useful comment, contribution or found a bug on the styles,
please, let me or the current maintainer know. This way we can provide an up
to date style and so you don't need to worry about formatting but keep
focused on your research.

Enjoy! Sincerely,

Bruno Menegola
